## Compilation

Converting the *source code* written in **C** to *machine code* the computer understands.

1. Source code

```c
int main(void)

## Arrays

An **array** is a *data structure* that stores a collection of elements, such as integers or characters, back-to-back in the computer's memory. This optimizes data storage and makes it easier to search, sort and iterate over the data.

Using **variables** only to store a wide range of data is **not** appropriate design. We would store each element separately, and it would be difficult to scale and keep track of the data.

```c
night1 = 7
night2 = 8
night3 = 6
night4 = 7
night5 = 8
```

|night1|night2|night3|night4|night5|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|7|8|6|7|8|

We can use an **array** to optimize the storing of this data:

|nights|
|:-:|
|7 8 6 7 8|

```c
nights[0] = 7
nights[2] = 8
nights[3] = 6
nights[4] = 7
nights[5] = 8
```

Arrays are **"zero-indexed"**, meaning that the first element in the array is located at index zero `[0]`. In other words, when we access elements in an array, we start counting from zero.

In **C** arrays, we need to specify the following:

- Data type `int`
- Name `nights`
- Size (How many elements?) `[5]`

```c
int nights[5]
```

If we wanted to not only *declare* the array, but also *initialize it* with values:

```c
int nights[5] = {7, 8, 6, 7, 8};
```

> In **C** once you have declared the size of an array, it cannot be changed.

<br><br>

### Doubling Up

Let's create an **array** of *integers* in which:

- Each integer is `2` times the value of the previous integer.
- The first element is `1`.
- Print the array, integer by integer

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Declare the array
    int sequence[5];

    // Declare and print the first element of the array
    sequence[0] = 1;
    printf("%i\n", sequence[0]);

    // loop that iterates through the indexes
    // i = index of array we are trying to set
    for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++)
    {
       // Multiply the values by 2
       sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] * 2;
       // Print each value
       printf("%i\n", sequence[i]);
    }
}
```

This code will return:

```txt
1
2
4
8
16
```

We can also modify the main function to declare a variable called `size` to make it easier to change:

```c
int main(void)
{
    int size = 8;
    int sequence[size];

    sequence[0] = 1;
    printf("%i\n", sequence[0]);

    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++)
    {
       sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] * 2;
       printf("%i\n", sequence[i]);
    }
}
```

This code will return:

```txt
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
128
```

We could also prompt the user for the size of the array:

```c
int main(void)
{
    int size = get_int("Enter size: ");
    int sequence[size];

    sequence[0] = 1;
    printf("%i\n", sequence[0]);

    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++)
    {
       sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] * 2;
       printf("%i\n", sequence[i]);
    }
}
```

<br><br>

## Strings

A **string** is an array, where the elements are characters `char`.

HELLO

```c
phrase[0] = H
phrase[1] = E
phrase[2] = L
phrase[3] = L
phrase[4] = O
```

### In **C** we use **ASCII** to represent letters of the alphabet by integers

|Character|Integer|
|:-:|:-:|
|A|65|
|B|66|
|C|67|
|...|...|

<br><br>

|phrase|
|:-:|
|H E L L O|
|72 69 76 76 79|

<br><br>

### Alphabetical

Let's create a program to check if an array of characters is in alphabetical order.

- Assume the characters ar all uppercase

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    string phrase = get_string("Enter a phrase: ");
    int length = strlen(phrase);

    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
    {
        printf("%i ", phrase[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

or

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    string phrase = get_string("Enter a phrase: ");

    // If the first variable is of type "int", it is implied that the one after the coma is too
    for (int i = 0, length = strlen(phrase); i < length; i++)
    {
        printf("%i ", phrase[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

- If we input `hello`, we will get `104 101 108 108 111`
- If we input `HELLO`, we will get `72 69 76 76 79`

> Our exercise asks us to assume that the characters are all in *uppercase*.

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    string phrase = get_string("Enter a phrase: ");

    for (int i = 0, length = strlen(phrase); i < length - 1; i++)
    {
        // Check if characters are NOT alphabetical
        if (phrase[i] > phrase[i + 1])
        {
            printf("Not in alphabetical order\n");
            return 0;
        }
    }
    printf("Alphabetical order!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Notice that the last `printf` function is outside of the `for loop`. This is done to respect the *scope* and for the program to go through every character of the string.
<br><br>

## Command-Line Arguments

We're going to explore the idea of running programs and giving them input not while they run, but before they run, using the **command line**.

We are used to running programs, and only when prompted give an input:

```c
int main(void)
{
    int height = get_int("Height: ");
}
```

The terminal would look like this:

```txt
$ ./mario
Height: 8
```

Now, we are going to transition and allow the user to give input **before** the program runs:

```txt
./mario 8
```

To allow this, we have to change the code and instead of `(void)`, add **arguments** to our `main` function:

```c
int main(void)
{
    
}
```

### Let's breakdown `int main(void)`:<br>

`int` tells us the **exit status code**: If `0`, the program was executed successfully.<br>
`main` is the name of the function<br>
`(void)` means the function takes no arguments.<br>
To run the program user only types `./mario`
<br><br>

Now let's add arguments to the **main** function:

```c
 int main(int argc, string argv[])
 {

 }
```

### Let's break down `int main(int argc, string argv[])`,<br>

`argc` is an argument of type integer and its value is equivalent to the number of arguments the program receives at the command line: `./mario 8` would mean `argc = 2`.<br>
`argv[]` is an array of strings at the command line. In `./mario 8` it contains `2` strings: The name of the program `./mario` and the input that user gave `8`.
<br><br>

### Argv

If we wanted to create a program that reveals what is inside `argv[]`:

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, string argv[])
{
    // argc here tells us the number of inputs
    for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++)
    {
        // Print each argv[] index and its value
        printf("argv[%i] is %s\n", i, argv[]);
    }
}
```

When we type `./argv 1 2 3`, the program will return:

```txt
argv[0] is ./argv
argv[1] is 1
argv[2] is 2
argv[3] is 3
```

<br><br>

### Error

`Segmentation fault (core dumped)` error happens when we look **beyond** the bounds of the array. When checking for values, make sure to index within the range of the array.

To make sure user inputs the correct format we can implement a **conditional function** that will return an error before the program crashes:

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, string argv[])
{
    if (argc != 2)
    {
        printf("Usage: ./mario number\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // using the "atoi" function from <stdlib.h> we convert argv[] in int
    int height = atoi(argv[1]);
}
```
