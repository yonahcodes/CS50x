# Harvard University's CS50x - 2024

![This is CS50](img/this_is_cs50.png)

## Welcome to my CS50 Repository

### [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/)

In this repository, I will be documenting my progress in Harvard Universityâ€™s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) course. Here, you will find a compilation of my projects and notes.

I chose to include specifically the **C** programming portion and the foundational concepts in computer science, including *data structures* and *algorithms*, as those were the areas I was most interested in exploring.

Hope it proves useful to someone. Happy coding!
