## Welcome to Lazer's CS50 Repository

### [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/)

In this repository I will be documenting my progress in Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) course. Here, you will find a compilation of my projects and notes. Hope it proves useful to someone. Happy coding!
