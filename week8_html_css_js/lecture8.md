## The internet

The **internet** is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the internet protocol suite `TCP/IP` to send packets of data between networks and devices. The **ARPANET** connected the first points on the internet to one another. Dots between two points could be considered **routers**.

## Routers

To route data from point A to point B, we need to make **routing decisions** and program how data is transferred. Data could take multiple paths from point A and point B, such that when a router is congested, data can flow through another path. `Packets` of data are transferred from one router to another, from one computer to another.

`TCP/IP` are two **protocols** that allow computers to transfer data between them over the internet.

`IP` or `internet protocol` is a way by which computers can be **identified** across the internet. Every computer has a unique address in the world. Addresses are in this form:
```
#.#.#.#
```
