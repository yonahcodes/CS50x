# C - Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

In order to manipulate and work with variables and values of C, we have a number of **operators** at our disposal.

>In C we can add `+`, subtract `-`, multiply `*` and divide `/` numbers, as expected.

```c
int x = y + 1;
x = x * 5;
```

We also have the **modulus operator** `%`, which gives us the *remainder* when the number on the left of the operator is divided by the number on the right.

```c
int m = 13 & 4; // m in now 1
```

>C also provides a shorthand way to apply an arithmetic operator to a single variable

```c
x = x * 5;
x *= 5;
```

This trick works with all five basic arithmetic operators. C provides a further shorthand for incrementing or decrementing a variable by **1**:

```c
x++;
x--;
```

## Boolean Expressions

Boolean expressions are used in C for comparing values.

> All Boolean expressions in C evaluate to one of two possible value - **true** or **false**

We can use the result of evaluating  a **Boolean** expression in other programming constructs such as deciding which branch in a **conditional** to take, or determining whether a **loop** should continue to run.

> In C, every non zero value is equivalent to **true**, and zero is **false**.

There is two main types of Boolean expressions: *logical operators* and *relational operators*.

## Logical operators

Logical **AND** `&&` is true if and only if **both operands** are true, otherwise false.

|x|y|(x && y)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|true|true|**true**|
|true|false|false|
|false|true|false|
|false|false|false|

Logical **OR** `||` is true if and only if at least one operand is true, otherwise false.

<!-- To prevent text & signs being recognized as markdown, and having its formatting respectively changed (in this case || in the table). Have (\) placed before -->

|x|y|(x \|\|  y)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|true|true|true|
|true|false|true|
|false|true|true|
|false|false|**false**|

Logical **NOT** `!` inverts the value of its operand.

|x|!x|
|:-:|:-:|
|true|*false*|
|false|*true*|

## Relational operators

These behave as you would expect them to, and appear syntactically similar to how you may recall them from elementary arithmetic.

- Less than `x < y`
- Less than or equal to `x <= y`
- Greater than `x > y`
- Greater than or equal to `x >= y`

C also can test two variables for **equality** and **inequality**.

- Equality `x == y`
- Inequality `x != y`

> Be careful! it's a common mistake to use the assignment operator `=` when you intend to use the equality operator `==`.
