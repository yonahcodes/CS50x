## Variables and Types

A **variable** is container paired with a symbolic name for some value that can change

```c
int calls = 3;
```

The code above creates an integer names calls that gets the value 3.

Breaking it down:

- `int` is the integer type variable

- `calls` is the name of the variable

- `3` is the value of the variable

- `=` is the assignment operator

```c
int country_code = 65;
```

the code above creates an integer names country_code that gets the value 65.

> We specify the type of variable `int`. 65 is stored as binary value **01000001** by the computer.

```c
char country_code = 65;
```

In this case the binary vale of 01000001 is stored as a `char` (character) equivalent to "A"

We can use **syntactic sugar** to make the code shorter in C :

```c
int calls = 4;
calls = calls + 2;
calls = calls - 1;
calls = calls * 2;
calls = calls / 2;
```

When we run the code above, the result is 5.

```c
int calls = 4;
calls += 2;
calls -= 1;
calls *= 2;
calls /= 2;
```

When we run the code, the result is **4 instead of 4.5**. Any decimal result is **"Truncated"**, not rounded.

> Integers are whole numbers, they do not store decimal values.

<br><br>

## Input and Printing

```c
int calls = get_int("Calls: "); 
```

`get_int("Calls: ");` is a **function call**.
> `get_int` is a function created by cs50.

When the user is prompted to enter a **value**, it is stored in the variable. If user enters "**4**":

`int calls = 4`

```c
int calls = 4;
printf("calls is %i\n", calls);
```

The code above will return "**calls is 4**"

Breaking it down:

- The `f` in the `printf` function stands for **formatted**

- `%i` is the placeholder for the value of the variable `calls`

- The value of the *variable* that follows the coma `,` will be stored in the placeholder:

- **printf("calls is %i\n", `calls`);**
<br><br>

## Types and format codes

- int `%i`

- float `%f`

- char `%C`

- string `%s`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world.\n");
}
```

Breaking it down:

- `#include <stdio.h>` Includes header file stdio C library

- the `main` function serves as the entry point of every C program.

- `int` specifies the return type of the "main" function.

- `(void)` This part specifies the parameter list of the main function. "void" means the function does not expect any command-line arguments.
<br><br>

## Getting input from user

Using the CS50 library `<cs50.h>`, we can easily obtain user input:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{
    string name = get_string("What is your name? ");
    printf("Hello, %s\n", name);
}
```

`#include <cs50.h>` give us access to the cs50 library that includes The `get_string` function we are using.

- We declare a variable of type **string** called "name"

- We assign to it an input from user with function `get_string("What is your name? ");`

- The function prompts user for his name and stores it in the variable.

- `printf("Hello, %s\n", name);` function prints "Hello, user-input"

- `%s` is a string type placeholder for the string type variable prompted by user

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    string first_name = get_string("What is your first name? ");
    string last_name = get_string("What is your last name? ");
    printf("Hello, %s %s\n", first_name, last_name);
}
```

> In this program we prompt the user for two inputs that we store in 2 different variables.

`printf("Hello, %s %s\n", first_name, last_name);` Function uses 2 placeholders and after the coma specifies which values should replace the placeholders in the result.

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    string name = get_string("What is your name? ");
    int age = get_int("What is your age? ");
    string phone = get_string("What is your phone number? ");

    printf("Name: %s\n", name);
    printf("Age: %i\n", age);
    printf("Phone: %s\n", phone);
}
```

In the program above we prompt the user for 3 inputs (name, age, phone number) and we display contact information.
>We chose **string type** for the phone number to include a variation of entries.

<br><br>

## Functions, Loops and Conditionals

### While Loops

These **loops** are useful when not sure when the condition will be true.

```c
int j = 0;
While (j < 4)
{
    printf("#");
    j++;
}
printf("\n");
```

The code above will return "####" by repeatedly executing the loop until `j` is no longer less than 4.

- `int j = 0;` Creates variable called j and stores value of 0 in it

- `While (j < 4) {}` While the condition is True (value of j is less than 4)

- `printf("#");` Print a single #

- `j++;` Increase value of j by 1

- *The loop then goes back to the top with new value to reassess the condition, and runs the loop over and over until the condition returns false (j = 4).*

- `printf("\n");` Move to a new line

### For Loops

These next **loops** are useful when wanting to specify how many times we want to iterate.

```c
for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++)
{
    printf("#");
}
printf("\n");
```

`for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++)` achieves the same result as the *while loop* in a more compact form with the following order:

- Create a variable called **j** and assign value of "**0**" to it.
- Ask **0 < 4** ? Yes, so we move to j++ and becomes j = 1
- Print out "#"

- Goes back up to ask **1 < 4** ? Yes, so we move to j++ and becomes j = 2
- Print out "##"

- Goes back up to ask **2 < 4** ? Yes, so we move to j++ and becomes j = 3
- Print out "###"

- Goes back up to ask **3 < 4** ? Yes, so we move to j++ and becomes j = 4
- Print out "####"

- Goes back up to ask **4 < 4** ? No
- We move to printf("\n");

### Nested Loops

We can create patterns using nested loops, such as a 4x4 grid of `#`

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++)
    {
        printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

The code above will return:

```md
####
####
####
####
```

We can create a 4 x 4 # grid (superposed 4 lines of 4 #) by nesting the same for loop in the original for loop.
> Note that we need to make variables different in both loops

```c
int get_int(string prompt)
{
    // Get int from user
}
```

>`get_int` function is defined by cs50. It prompts user with a string to enter integer value in the example: `int height = get_int("Height: ");`

Defining and using functions is a key aspect of C programming. Here's an example:

```c
void print_row(int length);

int main(void)
{
    int height = get_int("Height: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)
    {
        print_row(i + 1);
    }
}

void print_row(int bricks)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < bricks; i++)
    {
        printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

This program prompts the user for the height of a pyramid and prints the corresponding rows.

- First loop sets what will be the height or how many rows will the code print using user's input.
- Second loop `print_row` defines how many `#` will be printed in each line.

>Before calling a function we need to define it. If it's defined below where it is called, the program will not run. We need to include above the call a function prototype (its name, input, and return value) ex: `void print_row(int length);`

<br><br>

## Parameters VS Arguments

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration with parameters
int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    // Function call with arguments
    int result = addNumbers(5, 7);

    // Print the result
    printf("Sum: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example,  `a` and `b`  are parameters declared in the function `addNumbers`

`5` and `7` are the arguments passed during the function call in `main`.
